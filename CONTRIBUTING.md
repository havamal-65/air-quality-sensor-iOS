## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple code of conduct:
- Be respectful and professional
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Help create a welcoming environment for all contributors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**For App Development:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- For iOS: Mac with Xcode 14+ (see [iOS-SETUP.md](iOS-SETUP.md))
- For Android: Android Studio
- Expo CLI and EAS CLI installed globally

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/air-quality-sensor-iOS.git
   cd air-quality-sensor-iOS
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/havamal-65/air-quality-sensor-iOS.git
   ```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd app
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or updates

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the code standards outlined below
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Brief description of what you added"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `Add:` - New features
- `Fix:` - Bug fixes
- `Update:` - Changes to existing features
- `Refactor:` - Code improvements without functionality changes
- `Docs:` - Documentation updates
- `Test:` - Test additions or modifications

**Examples:**
```
Add: Dark mode toggle in settings screen
Fix: BLE connection timeout on Android
Update: CO2 threshold values based on WHO guidelines
Refactor: Simplify BLE manager initialization logic
Docs: Add troubleshooting section to README
```

### 4. Keep Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Mobile App)

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Follow React Native best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic only

**Code Formatting:**
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Semicolons: Not required (rely on ASI)
- Quotes: Single quotes for strings
- Line length: Maximum 100 characters

**Example:**
```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

interface SensorCardProps {
  value: number;
  unit: string;
  label: string;
}

export default function SensorCard({ value, unit, label }: SensorCardProps) {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('#4CAF50');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Update color based on value thresholds
    if (value > 1000) setColor('#F44336');
    else if (value > 800) setColor('#FF9800');
    else setColor('#4CAF50');
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>
      <Text>{label}: {value} {unit}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Important Rules:**
- Never hardcode sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
- No hardcoded values; use constants or configuration
- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch
- Always clean up resources (BLE connections, timers, etc.)

### File Organization

**Mobile App Structure:**
```
app/
├── app/              # Screens (Expo Router)
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── utils/           # Utility functions (BLE, helpers)
├── store/           # State management (Zustand)
├── constants/       # Configuration and constants
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
└── assets/          # Images, icons, fonts
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Mobile app: Test on both iOS and Android
   - Verify no regressions

2. **Update documentation:**
   - Update README if adding features
   - Add code comments for complex logic
   - Update iOS-SETUP.md if changing build process

3. **Clean commit history:**
   - Squash trivial commits
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Rebase on latest main if needed

- Email data directly

## Use Case
Long-term tracking and analysis in external tools
```

## Development Tips

### iOS Development

- Always test on physical iPhone for BLE functionality
- iOS Simulator doesn't support real Bluetooth
- See [iOS-SETUP.md](iOS-SETUP.md) for detailed iOS workflow
- Use Expo Go for quick testing during development

### Android Development

- Test on both physical device and emulator
- Check for permission issues (Bluetooth, Location)
- Verify BLE scanning works across Android versions

### BLE Development

- Always clean up connections on unmount
- Handle connection timeouts gracefully
- Test with actual sensor hardware when possible
- Demo mode should simulate realistic data

### Testing Without Hardware

The app includes a demo mode that:
- Simulates realistic sensor data
- Allows UI/UX testing without hardware
- Generates historical data automatically

Enable demo mode by running the app without connecting to a device.
